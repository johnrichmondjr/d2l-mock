## Project Scope

This project is a Mock D2L app that has some features that are available in DePaul's D2L software. The software consist of a few different components: Students, Course Admins, Course, Course features, and Discussion Threads. Course Admins will be able to add and remove Courses for a given quarter. Students will be able to be assigned to courses and view courses. Both Course admins and Students will be able to contribute and post to Discussion Threads.

* Milestone 1: Define the project and base structure and areas where each members will be working on based on [prototype](https://app.moqups.com/OrQojpNkdxZkkrM2T6MAwr087SJ1ctHX/view/page/ad64222d5)

| 2 | Dependency Management  | Maven | Gradle | This seems to be the one our team is most familiar with
| 3 | Code  | Lombok | Code template code | We would love to not have to write a ton of boiler plate code for everything
| 4 | Configuration Management  | Yaml | .env files | Yaml is pretty standard industry wide for configuration management
