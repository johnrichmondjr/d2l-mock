## Project Scope

This project is a Mock D2L app that has some features that are available in DePaul's D2L software. The software consist of a few different components: Students, Student admins, Course Admins, Course, Course features, and Discussion Threads. Course Admins will be able to add and remove Courses for a given quarter. Students will be able to be assigned to courses and view courses. Student admins will be able to see some Course features that other students may not. Both Course admins and Students will be able to contribute and post to Discussion Threads.

* Milestone 1: Define the project and base structure and areas where each members will be working on based on [prototype](https://app.moqups.com/OrQojpNkdxZkkrM2T6MAwr087SJ1ctHX/view/page/ad64222d5)

## Conflict Resolution

Majority rules. If the majority of the group agrees on a key decision lets go with that and move forward with it. If someone is slacking on their contribution in the group lets all bubble it up to Ken.

## Communication Mechanism

We will meet via Zoom and communicate through text via Discord. We will meet once a week Tuesdays at 7pm CST.

## Meeting Journal

During our meeting on Tuesday September 17th we covered the following
* What portion of the project each member will work on
* We discussed conflict resolution
* What software we will use for prototyping
* The scope of the project

## Decision Made
| # | Area  | Decision | Alternative | Rationale
| ----------- | ----------- | --- | --- |--- |
| 1 | IDE | Will use VS Code |IntelliJ, Eclipse | We use VS Code for everything else so we like this one
| 2 | Dependency Management  | Maven | Gradle | This seems to be the one our team is most familiar with
| 3 | Code  | Lombok | Code template code | We would love to not have to write a ton of boiler plate code for everything
| 4 | Configuration Management  | Yaml | .env files | Yaml is pretty standard industry wide for configuration management
